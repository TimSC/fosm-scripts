    <p class='emphasis'>FOSM is a free map of the planet which anyone can use and contribute to.  It is very similar to OpenStreetMap
	except that it has more data and is licensed under the well-known Creative Commons attribution
	and share-alike license CC-BY-SA.</p>

    <p>Currently FOSM provides a reasonably functional API, but not all methods are available at this time.  Edits to existing OpenStreetMap content is

mirrored here normally within just a few minutes.</p>

    <p>Editing is now beta.  If you would like to try it out just <a href='/user/new'>create an account</a> and configure your favorite editor.</p>

<p><b>Potlatch.</b>  Click <a href='/p2/potlatchFosm.xml'>here</a> to edit with Potlatch 2.  This is the successor to the original Potlatch and while it's still under development I already prefer it and it's starting to be a rival to JOSM.</p>

<p><b>JOSM.</b>  The API has been tested with JOSM.  To contribute to FOSM you will need to make the following configuration change:
        <ul>
        <li>Within JOSM go to Preferences (from the menu Select Edit/Preferences or press F12).</li>
        <li>Select the Connection Settings tab, which is the second one down.</li>
        <li>Change the Base Server URL from http://www.openstreetmap.org/api to http://api.fosm.org/api</li>
        <li>Change the username and password to those of your FOSM account.</li>
        </ul>
</p>
<p><b>Merkaartor.</b>  The API has been tested with Merkaartor.  To use it you will need to make the following configuration changes:
         <ul>
         <li>Within Merkaartor go to Tools/Preferences and select the Data tab.</li>
         <li>Change the Website from http://www.openstreetmap.org to http://api.fosm.org</li>
         <li>Change the username and password to those of your FOSM account.</li>
         </ul>
